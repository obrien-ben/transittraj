# transittraj

An R package for reconstructing and visualizing transit vehicle
trajectories.

## Installation

You can install the development version of transittraj from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

This is an early development version of `transitraj`. Expect it to
change substantially without warning.

- Documenting & pushing complete set of tools for cleaning AVL data
- A set of vignettes/articles with tutorials, discussion of
  methodologies, and example applications
- Eventual submission to CRAN
