\description{
This dataset is an archive of WMATA's public GTFS-realtime feed, accessed
from their developer API. It has been reformatted from GTFS-rt to match
the TIDES standard for both fields and datatypes. This dataset is intended
to be used alongside the static GTFS feed provided in \code{wmata_gtfs}.
}

The dataset contains three bus routes, with two directions for each:
\itemize{
\item D40: Georgia Ave
\item C53 U St/Congress Heights
\item D96: Mass Ave to Bethesda
