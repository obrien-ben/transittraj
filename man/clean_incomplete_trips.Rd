\title{Filters out entire trips which do not meet distance or duration requirements.}
\usage{
clean_incomplete_trips(
  distance_df,
  max_trip_distance = Inf,
  min_trip_distance = -Inf,
  max_trip_duration = Inf,
  min_trip_duration = -Inf,
  max_distance_gap = Inf,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance_df}{A dataframe of linearized AVL data. Must include
\code{trip_id_performed}, \code{event_timestamp}, and \code{distance}.}

\item{max_trip_distance}{Optional. The maximum distance traveled over one
trip, in units of input \code{distance}. Default is Inf.}

\item{min_trip_distance}{Optional. The minimum distance traveled over one
trip, in units of input \code{distance}. Default is -Inf.}

\item{max_trip_duration}{Optional. The maximum event_timestamp duration
of one trip, in seconds. Default is Inf.}

\item{min_trip_duration}{Optional. The minimum event_timestamp duration
of one trip, in seconds. Default is -Inf.}

\item{max_distance_gap}{Optional. The maximum change in distance between two
observations, in units of input \code{distance}. Default is Inf.}

\item{max_time_gap}{Optional. The maximum time between two observations, in
seconds. Default is Inf.}

\item{return_removals}{Optional. A boolean, should the function return
a dataframe of trips removed and why? Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
The input distance_df, with violating trips removed.
If \code{return_removals = TRUE}, a dataframe of trips removed and why.
}
\description{
This function identifies trips that do not meet some acceptable duration and
distance traveled ranges, or that have large time or distance gaps in the
middle. Violating trips will be removed.
