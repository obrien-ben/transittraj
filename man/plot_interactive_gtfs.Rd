\title{Generates a Leaflet viewer of GTFS routes and stops.}
\usage{
plot_interactive_gtfs(
  gtfs,
  background = "Esri.WorldGrayCanvas",
  color_palette = "Dark2"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{A tidytransit GTFS object.}

\item{background}{Optional. A string for the background of the transit map,
from Leaflet's provider library (see \verb{leaflet::providers$}). Default is
Esri's light gray canvas (\code{"Esri.WorldGrayCanvas"}).}

\item{color_palette}{Optional. A string for the Leaflet color palette to
color routes. If \code{"gtfs"}, will use color codes in the GTFS \code{routes} file.
Default is \code{"Dark2"}.}
}
\value{
A Leaftlet object.

\description{
This function generates a simple Leaflet-based interactive map viewer of a
GTFS. This function is intended for quick and easy visualization of a GTFS
feed. As such, formatting options are relatively limited.
}
\details{
\subsection{Route Shapes and Stops}{

The primary goal of this function is to visualize and explore each GTFS
shape, including its associated \code{route_id} and \code{direction_id}. This function
will plot all shapes and stops present in the input \code{gtfs}. To plot only
a specific route or direction, first the feed using \code{filter_by_route()}.

Routes have both pop-ups and hover labels. The hover label shows the
shapes's \code{route_id} (from the \code{trips} file). The pop-up will show the
\code{route_id}, \code{direction_id}, and \code{shape_id}.

Stops also have both pop-ups and hover labels. The hover label will show the
point's \code{stop_id} (from the \code{stops} file). The pop-up will show the
\code{stop_name} and \code{stop_id}.
}

\subsection{Formatting}{

Two formatting options are available through this function: basemaps
and route color palettes.

The \code{background} parameter allows you to customize the background map below
the plotted shapes and stops. Esri's light grey canvas is the default, as it
is excellent for providing geographic context while still allowing the
routes to stand out. To see the available options, type
\verb{leaflet::providers$} into your console.

The route colors can be customized in two different ways:
\itemize{
\item Using the \code{gtfs}'s colors. Typically, the \code{routes} file in a GTFS feed
will contain a field \code{route_color}; this is the color you see in most
public-facing mapping/navigation applications (e.g., Google Maps, Transit,
etc.). If this is present in the input \code{gtfs} feed, setting
\code{color_palette = "gtfs"} will use this field to color each shape.
\item Using a named color palette. Without \code{gtfs} colors, this function
assigns colors categorically (using \code{leaflet::colorFactor()}). To set
the palette, input a string corresponding to a palette name from
\code{RColorBrewer}, a palette name from \code{viridis}, a vector of color names (with
the same length as the number of shapes), or some other color function. See
Leaflet's
\href{https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/articles/colors.html}{colors vignette}
for more information.
