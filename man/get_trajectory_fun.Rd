\arguments{
\item{distance_df}{A dataframe of linearized AVL data. Must include
\code{trip_id_performed}, \code{event_timestamp}, and \code{distance}. If
\code{use_speed = TRUE}, must also include \code{speed}.}

\item{interp_method}{Optional. The type of interpolation function to be fit.
Either \code{"linear"}, or a spline method from \code{stats::splinefun()}. Default is
\code{"monoH.FC"}.}

\item{use_speeds}{Optional. A boolean, should curves be constrained by
observed AVL speeds? Should only be used with \code{interp_method = "monoH.FC"},
but \code{monoH.FC} does not require speeds. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{find_inverse_function}{Optional. A boolean, should the numeric inverse
function (time ~ distance) be calculated? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{inv_tol}{Optional. A numeric in the units of input \code{distance}, the
tolerance used when calculating the numeric inverse function. Default is
0.01.}

\item{return_group_function}{Optional. A boolean, should the returned
trajectory object be grouped into a single function? If FALSE, will return a
list (indexed by \code{trip_id_performed}) of single trajectory objects. Default
is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
If \code{return_group_function = TRUE}, a grouped trajectory object. If
\code{FALSE}, a list of single trajectory objects, index by their
\code{trip_id_performed}.

\description{
This function fits a continuous vehicle trajectory function to observed AVL
points, returning a trajectory object. Interpolation can be done linearly
(\code{interp_method = "linear"}), or via any method supported by
\code{stats::splinefun()}.

\details{
\subsection{Interpolating Methods}{

The goal of this function is to fit a continuous function representing a
vehicle's distance traveled as a function of time, for each trip. This
function supports to types of interpolating curves:
\itemize{
\item Linear interpolation, for \code{interp_method = "linear"}. This will fit a
simple linear function, ignorant of recorded \code{speed} values.
\item Spline interpolation, for \code{interp_method} set to any method supported by
\code{stats::splinefun()} (i.e., \code{"fmm"}, \code{"natural"}, \code{"periodic"}, \code{"monoH.FC"},
or \code{"hyman"}.) Only \code{interp_method = "monoH.FC"} supports use of recorded
\code{speed} values.
}

By default, \code{interp_method = "monoH.FC"} and \code{use_speeds = TRUE}. This will
yield a continuous, differentiable, monotonic, and invertible trajectory,
and is the standard transit trajectory interpolation technique. If the input
\code{distance} and \code{speed} values satisfy Fritsch-Carlson, the interpolating
function is guaranteed to be montonic. See \code{make_monotonic()} and
\code{validate_monotonicity()}.

Note that \code{use_speeds = TRUE} requires \code{interp_method = "monoH.FC"}, but
\code{interp_method = "monoH.FC"} does not require \code{use_speeds = TRUE}. In this
scenario, a "velocity-ignorant' Fritsch-Carlson interpolating function
can be created. If input \code{distance} values are monotonic, this curve is
guaranteed to be monotonic.
}

\subsection{Inverse Functions}{

Often times, we are concerned not with the position of a vehicle at a
particular time, but when a vehicle crosses a specific point in space. This
can be accomplished by computing an inverse trajectory function. If
\code{find_inverse_function = TRUE} (the default), a numeric inverse to the fit
trajectory function will be found, with a tolerance controlled by \code{inv_tol}.

Because the inverse function is numerical, it can be found for any type of
interpolating curve (linear or spline). However, the input data must be
strictly monotonic for the trajectory curve to be invertible. If
\code{find_inverse_function = TRUE}, this will be verified before proceeding (see
\code{validate_monotonicity()}).
}

\subsection{The Trajectory Object}{

A trajectory function does not exist by itself; rather, it requires the
context about the trip it describes, as well as its inverse function. As
such, \code{get_trajectory_fun()} returns an AVL trajectory object. If
\code{return_group_function = TRUE} (the default), the function will return a
single object containing:
\itemize{
\item A vector of \code{trip_id_performed}s present in \code{distance_df}.
\item A list of fit trajectory functions, indexed by their \code{trip_id_performed}.
\item A list of fit inverse trajectory functions, indexed by their
\code{trip_id_performed}.
\item Information about how the trajectory and inverse trajectory functions were
fit, including \code{interp_method}, \code{use_speeds}, and \code{inv_tol}.
\item A vector each for the minimum distances, maximum distances, minimum times,
and maximum times of each trip. These inform the domain and range of the
trajectory function and its inverse, preventing extrapolation beyond the
time or distance range actually served by a trip.
}

Alternatively, if \code{return_group_function = FALSE}, a separate trajectory
object will be fit for each trip. \code{get_trajectory_fun()} will return a list
of trajectory objects indexed by their \code{trip_id_performed}.

More information about the trajectory object classes and how to use them is
available at (xyz).
