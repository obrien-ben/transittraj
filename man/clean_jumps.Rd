\title{Applies median filters to detect large jumps (i.e., outliers) in the
trajectories.}
\usage{

  distance_df,
  neighborhood_width = 7,
  t_cutoff = 3,
  min_median_deviation = -Inf,

}
\arguments{
\item{distance_df}{A dataframe of linearized AVL data. Must include
\code{trip_id_performed}, \code{event_timestamp}, and \code{distance}.}

\item{neighborhood_width}{Optional. An integer representing the total sliding
window width around each observation. Default is 7 (3 on either side).}

\item{t_cutoff}{Optional. For Hampel filters, number of standardized MADs
away to consider an outlier. Default is 3.}

\item{min_median_deviation}{Optional. A numeric, the minimum allowed
deviation of an observation from its window median, in units of distance.
Default is \code{-Inf}.}

\item{max_median_deviation}{Optional. A numeric, the maximum allowed
deviation of an observation from its window median, in units of distance.
Default is \code{-Inf}.}

\item{evaluate_tails}{Optional. A boolean, should the beginning and ending
observations, before a complete window can be formed, be evaluated? Default
is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{evaluate_implosions}{Optional. A boolean, should points in implosion
sequences be evaluated? "Implosions" occur when more than half of a window is
constant. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{replace_outliers}{Optional. A boolean, should points identified as
outliers be replaced by their window median? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{return_removals}{Optional. A boolean, should the function return
a dataframe of points removed and why? Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
The input \code{distance_df} with violating points removed. If
\code{return_removals = TRUE}, a dataframe with observations removed and why.

\description{
Noise in GPS trajectories can manifest itself as one or more points lying far
away from points recorded at a similar time. This function identifies these
points using median filters. By default, outliers are removed. See \code{Details}
for a discussion of removal methodologies.
}
\details{
There are many different types of median filters. In general, these filters
create a sliding window around each point (here, controlled by
\code{neighborhood_width}) and treats a point based on its deviation from the
median of that window. This function supports two main ways of classifying
outliers based on their deviation:
\itemize{
\item Raw deviation: \code{min_median_deviation} and \code{max_median_deviation} set
bounds for an acceptable deviation between a point and the median of the
window around it, in units of the input \code{distance} column.
\item Hampel filter: Uses the median absolute deviation (MAD), the median of
deviations from the median. With a conversion factor (\code{s = 1.48}), this is
analogous to a standard error. The \code{t_cutoff}, then, is analogous to an
acceptable window of \code{t} values.
}

Both of these can be used at the same time. If multiple criteria are set,
a point will be removed if it violates any criterion.

A Hampel filter is generally considered highly robust, and is the recommended
approach. There are, however, two main limitations to be aware of:
\itemize{
\item It can struggle at the beginnings and ends of trips, before a complete
window can be formed. Use \code{evaluate_tails} to skip these.
\item When more than hald of a window has the same value, the MAD is 0 and an
observation is guaranteed to be flagged as an outlier. This is known as an
"implosion". As we expect noise in GPS data, even when a vehicle is standing
still, this is unlikely. It can occur, however, near trip terminals, where
many GPS points snap to the exact same point on the route alignment. Use
\code{evaluate_implosions} to identify and skip points in an implosion.
}

Once a point has been identified as an outlier, there are two possible
treatments, controlled by \code{replace_outliers}:
\itemize{
\item Replacement with the window median. This is the most common approach to
median filters, but is likely not appropriate for AVL data. Replacement
may introduce non-monotonicities.
\item Removal of the point. This is a less common approach, but may be a more
sensible for this application, given that interpolating curves will be fit
later in the cleaning process.
