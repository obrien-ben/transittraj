\title{Removes observations occurring before a trip's minimum distance, or after a
trip's maximum distance.}
\usage{
trim_trips(distance_df, trim_type = "both", return_removals = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance_df}{A dataframe of linearized AVL data. Must include
\code{trip_id_performed}, \code{event_timestamp}, and \code{distance}.}

\item{trim_type}{Optional. A string, indicating whether the beginning of
trips, end of trips, or both beginning and end of trips should be trimmed.
Must be one of "beginning", "end", or "both". Default is "beginning".}

\item{return_removals}{Optional. A boolean, should the function return
a dataframe of points removed and why? Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
The input \code{distance_df} with violating points removed. If
\code{return_removals = TRUE}, a dataframe with observations removed and why.
}
\description{
Sometimes observations will be recorded under a trip ID while a vehicle is
still traveling in the opposite direction. Conversely, a trip may continue
recording as it begins traversing the opposite direction. This function
attempts to remove these observations by identifying each trip's minimum
(beginning) and maximum (ending) distance, then filtering to only
observations after and before these points. For both ends, the first
occurrence of the beginning/maximum value is used.
