\description{
This function is a helepr for \code{gganimate}'s \code{anim_save()}, providing a
simplified, though less feature-rich, version of these functions. Animations
are saved as \code{.gif}s at the desired path. With this function,
publication-quality (high-resolution and smooth) animations are possible,
but take a long time to render.
