# transittraj

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An R package for reconstructing and visualizing transit vehicle trajectories.

This is an early development version of `transittraj`. Expect it to change
without warning.

## Introduction

Today's transit vehicles generate a large amount of automatic vehicle location
(AVL) data. This data is vital in planning and performance studies, but turning
sparse and noisy GPS pings into meaningful performance metrics is difficult.
`transittraj` fills this gap, integrating with existing open data standards,
including GTFS and TIDES, to provide tools for cleaning AVL data and fitting
continuous, monotonic, invertible, and differentiable trajectory curves. 
By doing so, `transittraj` provides versatile and powerful tools to analyze
transit system performance and support decision-making.

``` {r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "`transittraj` turns noisy GPS data (left) into a trajectory (right) meeting the four requirements discussed below"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-example2.png")
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of `transittraj` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("UTEL-UIUC/transittraj")
```

## Statement of Need

The primary goal of `transittraj` is to reconstruct *trajectories* of transit
vehicles from AVL data. A trajectory is a function which describes the
one-dimensional position (i.e., the distance from a trip's beginning) of a
transit vehicle over time. Vehicle trajectories are incredibly powerful and
versatile tools, and are widely used by traffic engineers and operations
researchers for planning and system performance studies.

Despite this, transit professionals rarely have the opportunity to see detailed
trajectories of their vehicles, and instead typically only receive finalized
metrics -- such as dwell time and segment-level travel times -- from analytics
platforms. If a practitioner wanted to apply trajectory fitting tools from
parallel fields, they would likely encounter challenges: transit data adheres
to unique formatting standards; very few open-source tools exist for handling
transit vehicle location data; and, most importantly, common GPS processing
techniques can oversmooth transit trajectories, as AVL pings occur with the
same frequency (15-30 seconds) as stop dwells, signal delays, and other
stop-and-go cyles.

`transittraj` fills this gap this gap by proposing a workflow with two main
steps. The first is data cleaning, where we focus on correcting noise and
errors in point observations. Second, we use cleaned position and speed
measurements to fit an interpolating curve representing the vehicle's
trajectory. This curve has four important attributes:

- *Continuous*: There should be no gaps in the trajectory for each trip.

- *Monotonic*: The trajectory should be strictly increasing -- transit vehicles
typically don't back up in service.

- *Invertible*: The trajectory should provide position as a function of time,
or time as a function of position.

- *Differentiable*: At any point on the curve, we should be able to interpolate
for the speed of the vehicle.

`transittraj` aims to make these workflows as smooth and accessible as possible.
We begin with data that adheres to industry standard data formats, including
[GTFS](https://gtfs.org/) and [TIDES](https://tides-transit.org/main/). In our
cleaning and trajectory fitting, our functions are flexible but avoid
techniques which require complex tuning. Finally, we provide tools to
visualize and apply fit trajectory curves.

## Works in Progress

This package is still in early development. In prepartion for an eventual
submission to CRAN, we're still working on the following:

- Examples in all function documentation

- Sample datasets to include with `transittraj`

- Formal automated testing

- Vignettes discussing methodology and inner-workings of `transittraj`
